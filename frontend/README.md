# Sentiment Analysis Frontend

This is the **React + TypeScript frontend** for the Sentiment Analysis API project.  
It allows users to:

- Analyze text sentiment (Positive / Negative)
- View and manage feedback
- View statistics about all feedback entries

The frontend interacts with the **FastAPI backend** to perform these operations.
